# Quant Interview Questions: Numerical Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each exploring a quantitative finance interview question through numerical simulations and mathematical derivations. The questions are sourced from personal experience, online resources, and books, designed to help users prepare for quant interviews or deepen their understanding of probabilistic and mathematical concepts.

## Overview
Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository tackles a unique quant interview question, typically involving probability, statistics, or mathematical finance. The notebooks combine numerical simulations (brute-force approaches) with rigorous mathematical derivations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and its extensions.

## Notebook Structure
Each notebook follows a consistent format:
1. **Question**: The quant interview question, clearly stated.
2. **Simulation**: A numerical experiment (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation) to estimate the answer via brute-force methods.
3. **Mathematical Derivation**: Analytical solutions derived using one or more mathematical approaches (e.g., probability theory, combinatorics, or calculus).
4. **Extensions**: Variations or generalizations of the original question to explore related concepts.

## Installation
To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wingkit1202/quant-interviews.git
